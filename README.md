Welcome to **Davoice WakeWord / Keywords Detection** ‚Äì Wake words and keyword detection solution designed by **DaVoice.io**.

## About this project

This is a **"<a href="https://davoice.io/wake-word" target="_blank">wake word</a>"** package for Python. 

A **"wake word"** is a keyword or a phrase that activates your device or commands your application, like "Hey Siri" or "OK Google". "Wake Word" is also known as "keyword detection", "Phrase Recognition", "Phrase Spotting", ‚ÄúVoice triggered‚Äù, ‚Äúhotword‚Äù, ‚Äútrigger word‚Äù

Except for **"Python wake word"** It also provide **"Python Speech to Intent"**. **Speech to Intent** refers to the ability to recognize a spoken word or phrase
and directly associate it with a specific action or operation within an application. Unlike a **"wake word"**, which typically serves to activate or wake up the application,
Speech to Intent goes further by enabling complex interactions and functionalities based on the recognized intent behind the speech.

For example, a wake word like "Hey App" might activate the application, while Speech
to Intent could process a phrase like "Play my favorite song" or "Order a coffee" to
execute corresponding tasks within the app.
Speech to Intent is often triggered after a wake word activates the app, making it a key
component of more advanced voice-controlled applications. This layered approach allows for
seamless and intuitive voice-driven user experiences.

# Features

- **Easy to use and deploy with Python:** Check out our example code and install scripts.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Integrate Davoice "Python wake word" into most known HW architectures and OS.
- **Low Latency:** Experience near-instantaneous keyword detection.
- **High Accuracy:** We have successfully reached over 99% accuracy for all our models.
- **Real-World Benchmarks:** At DaVoice, we believe in real benchmarks done by customers on actual use cases rather than static tests. We actively encourage our customers to share their real-world experiences and results.

# <u>Customer Benchmarks</u>

## <u>Customer Benchmark I:</u>
#### <u>Provided by **[Tyler Troy](https://lookdeep.health/team/tyler-troy-phd/)**, CTO & Co-Founder of **[LookDeep Health](https://lookdeep.health/)**</u>  
**[Tyler Troy](https://lookdeep.health/team/tyler-troy-phd/)** conducted an independent benchmark at **[LookDeep Health](https://lookdeep.health/)** to select a **"phrase detection"** vendor.

## **RESULTS BELOW:**

### **üî¥ Crucial Criteria I - False Positives**
- **This is THE most crucial criteria**, in hospital settings, false alerts are unacceptable‚Äîthey waste valuable time and can compromise patient care.  
- **‚úÖ DaVoice: "ZERO FALSE POSITIVES" within a month duration of testing.**  
- In contrast, Picovoice triggered several false alerts during testing, making it unsuitable for critical environments like hospitals.  
- OpenWakeWord was not tested for false positives because its true positive rate was too low.  

### **üî¥ Criteria II - True Positive**

===========================
DaVoice                    0.992481
Porcupine (Picovoice)      0.924812
OpenWakeWords              0.686567

# Python Wake word generator

## Create your "custom wake word" for Python

In order to generate your **"custom wake word"** you will need to:

- **Create Python wake word model:**
    Contact us at info@davoice.io with a list of your desired **"custom wake words"**.

    We will send you corresponding models typically your **wake word phrase .onnx** for example:

    A wake word ***"hey sky"** will correspond to **hey_sky.onnx**.

- **Add wake words to Python example:**
    Simply copy your model onnx files to:
    example/models/

    In example.py change the "need_help_now.onnx" to your model.onnx
    keyword_detection_models = ["models/need_help_now.onnx"]
    run python example.py
