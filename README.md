## Benchmark.

Our customers have benchmarked our technology against leading solutions, including Picovoice Porcupine, Snowboy, Pocketsphinx, Sensory, and others. 
In several tests, our performance was comparable to Picovoice Porcupine, occasionally surpassing it, however both technologies consistently outperformed all others in specific benchmarks. 
For detailed references or specific benchmark results, please contact us at ofer@davoice.io.

## Activating Microphone while the app operates in the background or during shutdown/closure.
This example in the Git repository enables Android functionality in both the foreground and background, and iOS functionality in the foreground. However, we have developed an advanced SDK that allows the microphone to be activated from a complete shutdown state on Android and from the background state on iOS. If you require this capability for your app, please reach out to us at ofer@davoice.io.

#### Example for iOS Background State

Apple restricts background microphone access for privacy and battery efficiency. However, certain applications, such as security apps, car controlling apps, apps for the blind or visually impaired may require this functionality.

Below is an example for one of the workarounds we have done in order to activate microphone with an empty listener. This approach avoids unnecessary battery usage until real audio capture is needed, at which point you can swap the placeholder listener with the actual microphone callback.

The example below, built in React Native, demonstrates this approach. The function backgroundMicEmptyListener() creates a minimal listener with negligible CPU impact, only processing the function call and return.

```javascript
const handleAppStateChange = (nextAppState) => {
  console.log("handleAppStateChange(): ", nextAppState);
  
  if (nextAppState === 'background') {
    console.log("nextAppState === 'background'");
    BackgroundJob.start(backgroundMicEmptyListener, backgroundOptions)
      .then(() => {
        console.log('Background job started successfully');
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        console.error('Error starting background job:', err);
      });
  }
}
```
